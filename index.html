<p>Before you can learn what's in, you need to learn what it is. The terms of service (commonly abbreviated as ToS or tos) are rules (or <bold>terms</bold> by which one must agree to abide in order to use a <bold>service </bold>. So basically, it's a constitution for a service. Most people have Windows&copy; for their computer/laptop's OS. Windows&copy; has a rather lengthy ToS. How many of you have read it? It's approximately 5,261 words, and it's in "lawyer talk", so even if the majority of you read it you wouldn't understand it. Here's a fun fact: Microsoft reserves the right to use 1-&infin; gb worth of data to aid in their servers and updates. They also reserve the right to delete everything on your computer, just because they want to.</p>

<p>A ToS can house anything from "No using any words that start with s, or you'll be banned" to "You agree that you will not solicit, collect or use the login credentials of other *service* users. The most common things are as follows: </p>
<ul class="ulb">
  <li>Copyright licensing on user content</li>
  <li>Disambiguation/definition of key words and phrases </li>
  <li> User rights and responsibilities </li>
  <ol>
      <li style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0);"> Proper or expected usage; potential misuse </li>
      <li> Proper or expected usage; potential misuse </li>
      <li> Accountability for online actions, behavior, and conduct </li>
      <li> Privacy policy outlining the use of personal data </li>
      <li> Payment details such as membership or subscription fees, etc. </li>
      <li> Opt-out policy describing procedure for account termination, if available </li>
  </ol>
  <li> Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability clarifying the site's legal liability for <br> damages incurred by users </li>
  <li> User notification upon modification of terms, if offered </li>

<p> One of the most famous ToS loopholes is AOL's. Upon agreeing to their terms,you practically waive your fourth amendment right. In United States v. Frank DiTomasso, the judge said "AOL’s policy is quite different. Not only does it explicitly warn users that criminal activity is disallowed, and that AOL monitors for such activity; the policy also explains that “AOL reserves the right to take any action it deems warranted” in response to illegal behavior, including “terminating] accounts and cooperat[ing] with law enforcement.” The policy also makes clear that AOL reserves the right to reveal to law enforcement information about “crimes[s] that [have] been or [are] being committed.” In contrast to Omegle’s policy, which includes only a passing reference to law enforcement — and which gives no indication of the role Omegle intends to play in criminal investigations — AOL’s policy makes clear that AOL intends to actively assist law enforcement. <bold> <em> For this reason, I conclude that a reasonable person familiar with AOL’s policy would understand that by agreeing to the policy, he was consenting not just to monitoring by AOL as an ISP, but also to monitoring by AOL as a government agent. Therefore, DiTomasso’s Fourth Amendment challenge fails as to the emails." </em> </bold>   </p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Contracts, ToS, and the Law. </h3>

<p> It is possible to break out of the contract you enter upon agreeing to the ToS. Four of themost common elements that courts and judicial systems look at when presented with a contract fued is as follows: </p>
<ul class="ulb">
  <li> The agreement is grossly unfair </li>
  <li style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0);" class="metooblue"> The other person retracts, or gives up, first. </li>
  <li> The other person retracts, or gives up, first. </li>
  <li style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0);" > The other party violates the contract's terms </li>
    <li> The other party violates the contract's terms </li>
  <li> The contract is fraudulent and grossly neglegant to the legal system </li>
</ul> <br />
